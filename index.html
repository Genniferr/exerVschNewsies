<p> SALT LAKE CITY — The Wasatch Front can expect more snow into early Monday afternoon after a wintry storm whitened the valley floor and dropped nearly 2 feet of snow at a ski resort on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p> Salt Lake and Tooele valleys and the northern Wasatch Front south of Ogden could see accumulations of snow up to 4 inches, the National Weather Service in Salt Lake City said.</p>

<p> “Periods of heavy snow will cause roadways to temporarily become snow covered, especially overpasses and all surfaces during the nighttime hours. Plan on slippery road conditions,” the weather service said Sunday.</p>

<p> Snowfall is expected to increase “just in time for the morning commute,” before tapering off early Monday afternoon, officials said.</p>
